# IncomeClassifier
# I did this project while doing a case Study in Python For DataScience Course from IIT- Madras, and built a classifer to classify if a certain person has a salary above or below $50000 by building Linear Regression model and KNN model. I Cleaned the data and then Trained the model using train data and then tested it using Test data to get the Accuracy of Each model.
